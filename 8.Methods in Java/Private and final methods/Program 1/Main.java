/*

When we use final specifier with a method, the method cannot be overridden in any of the inheriting classes. 
Methods are made final due to design reasons. 
Since private methods are inaccessible, they are implicitly final in Java. 
So adding final specifier to a private method doesnâ€™t add any value. 
It may in-fact cause unnecessary confusion.
