/*

Constructors are used to initialize the objectâ€™s state. 
Like methods, a constructor also contains collection of statements(i.e. instructions) 
that are executed at time of Object creation.

When is a Constructor called ?
Each time an object is created using new() keyword at least one constructor 
(it could be default constructor) is invoked to assign initial values to the data members 
of the same class.
