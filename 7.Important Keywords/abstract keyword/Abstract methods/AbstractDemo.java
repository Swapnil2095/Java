/*
Important rules for abstract methods:

Any class that contains one or more abstract methods must also be declared abstract

The following are various illegal combinations of other modifiers for methods with respect to abstract modifier :
final
abstract native
abstract synchronized
abstract static
abstract private
abstract strictfp

Note : Although abstract classes cannot be used to instantiate objects, 
they can be used to create object references, because Javaâ€™s approach to run-time polymorphism
 is implemented through the use of super-class references. Thus, it must be possible to create a reference 
 to an abstract class so that it can be used to point to a subclass object.
